# $\text{Oz∀n∈ℝ}\TeX$

The eponymous $\text{Oz∀n∈ℝ}\TeX$ is a $\TeX$ package of miscellaneous commands, preformatting, and default package inclusions. Rather than append these definitions at the top of all my $\LaTeX$ files, I decided to factor them out as a package.

Check out the [documentation](documentation.pdf) for a full list of inclusions as well as examples.
